# X
I created a twitter clone to learn to write front end, copying clever programmers twitter clone https://github.com/CleverProgrammers/twitter-clone . 

I've since tried to take it to the next level. Adding colored hovering functionality for buttons, posts and display names. I've added a bespoke right hand pane, written from scratch. I've also tweaked everything to make it look more like X than twitter.

After I'm happy with the front end, I'll look to wire this up to my own bespoke backend API.
